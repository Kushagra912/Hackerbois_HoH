Idea And approach: ● Creating a web application where citizens can report complaints,give
feedback.
● Jailor can log in as a user and can add the details of prisoners like name,
age, address, crime, and punishment, add the details about the different
guards that are on duty, write the First Information Report and can save
it. FIR’s date, time, number, and details can be seen any time if required
by the registered user.
● This system has the capability to maintain an infinite number of records.
● Admin can verify and add users but cannot see the complaints that are
saved by users in the database because these files must be kept secret
